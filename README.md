# 👋 Hi, I'm Anil Kumar

**Senior Android Developer | 9+ Years of Experience**

I’m a seasoned Android developer with 9+ years of experience building high-performance, scalable applications across both product and service domains. I specialize in modern Android development using **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, and robust architectures like **MVVM** and **Clean Architecture**.

I've worked on several consumer-facing and enterprise apps — some live on the Google Play Store, others used internally at scale. A few notable ones include:
